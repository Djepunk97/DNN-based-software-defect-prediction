# AndroidDefectPredicton #
The experimental data and resource of Defect Prediction in Android Binary Executables using Deep Neural Network

## DATA ##
Our sampels for defect prediction, including APK and source code file of 5 versions for 15 Android projects respectively.
You can get it at http://pan.baidu.com/s/1pKR5N0f

## SRC ##
Our source code file of feature & label generator, which is in Analyse. And DNN is our source code for Deep Neaural Network.
- If you want to run them, please confirm your TensorFlow enviroment has already been set up.  

## RESULTS ##
This folder contains part of the experimental results and there are all excel file.
1. dataset: All numerical information of defect prediction samples;
2. DNNconf: Results of differnt configuration of our DNN;
3. WP: Results of performance of different classifiers with within-project;
4. CP: Results of performance of different classifiers with cross-project;
5. TIME: The time and space consumption of traing and testing procedure of different classifiers.
